# Activity 4 - Graph Features and Machine Learning

This activity consists in the use of the NetworkX library to extract features from graphs, store and manipulate them using Pandas dataframes and finally applying Machine Learning models for prediction using Scikit Learn.

All code and information are contained in the Jupyter Notebook file (`ipynb` extension).
